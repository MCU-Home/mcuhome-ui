# mcuhome-ui

mcuhome-ui is MCUHome's web interface: a browser front end for the devices of
one project — editing a device's YAML, validating it, building, signing and
flashing its firmware, and managing the project's secrets, shared
configurations and options. It is the graphical half of the project's tooling,
working on the same project tree the command line works on.

## State of this repository

The interface is being rebuilt, and the earlier prototype has been removed
rather than carried along. What the repository holds today is the design the
rebuild follows — a rendered screen for every approved board plus the design
notes behind them, under [`docs/design/`](docs/design/) — the beginnings of
the new front end in [`frontend/`](frontend/), and the checks that run over
the tree.

The front end is Kotlin / Compose Multiplatform, built for the web platform
first. What exists so far is the application shell — the top bar, the
navigation tied to the browser's address bar and history, the theme built
from the brand tokens — the jobs chip that keeps a running build reachable
from every screen, and the four screens the interface is made of: the
devices table with its filters and the New device dialog, a device's own
page with the YAML editor, its status rail and the output panel, the shared
configuration files with their users, the secrets of all four scopes, and
the project's options, file, boards and doctor report. It talks to an
in-memory mock of the API described in [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md), so
screens can be built before the back end exists. It is one interface for
every screen size: the same screens rearrange themselves for a tablet and
for a phone — where the navigation moves behind a menu button, the device
list becomes rows, and the editor gets a YAML toolbar above the on-screen
keyboard — and every colour comes from the brand tokens in both the light
and the dark scheme. The back end — a Python
service on top of
[mcuhome-workbench](https://github.com/mcu-home/mcuhome-workbench), talking
to the front end only through that API over HTTP and WebSocket — is still
to come.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/api.md` | The API between the front end and the back end |
| `docs/design/` | The design reference: rendered screens and design notes |
| `frontend/` | The Kotlin / Compose Multiplatform front end |
| `scripts/` | The development gates — the `test` and `lint` dispatchers and their wrappers |
| `.github/` | Workflows, dependency updates, code ownership |

## Development — how to work on this repository

This repository has its own virtual environment in `.venv/`; nothing is
installed into the system Python or into another repository's environment.
`scripts/` holds the development tooling: `scripts/test` and `scripts/lint`
dispatch the checks — `all` runs every one, `list` names them, `<name>` runs
one — and each check is its own wrapper in `scripts/test.d/` or
`scripts/lint.d/`. Each wrapper picks its own tooling (never activate a
virtual environment by hand) and is exactly what CI runs, one job per check.

Needs Python ≥3.13. The `.venv` holds the linters and nothing else; they are
the `dev` dependency group of the root `pyproject.toml`, which declares no
package of its own.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install --group dev
```

```sh
scripts/lint all
scripts/test all
```

The checks are of two kinds. `codespell`, `hygiene` and `reuse` look at the
whole tree and come from the `.venv`. `ktlint`, `detekt` and `kotlin-test`
belong to the front end and run through its Gradle wrapper, so they need a
JDK 21 rather than the `.venv` — see below.

### The front end

The front end lives in `frontend/` and is built with Gradle. It needs a JDK
21; nothing else has to be installed, because the Gradle wrapper checked in
with the sources fetches the Gradle distribution it needs on first use, and
the Kotlin Gradle plugin fetches the Node-based tooling the WebAssembly
target needs. That first run therefore downloads a few hundred megabytes and
takes a while; later runs do not.

`scripts/test kotlin-test` runs the multiplatform tests. They are compiled to
WebAssembly and executed in a real browser: Karma starts Google Chrome in
headless mode, so Chrome has to be installed. It is found on `PATH` as
`google-chrome` or `google-chrome-stable`; a browser somewhere else is
pointed at with the `CHROME_BIN` environment variable.

`scripts/lint ktlint` and `scripts/lint detekt` check the Kotlin sources and
the Gradle build scripts. Both only report. What ktlint can fix by itself is
fixed by `cd frontend && ./gradlew ktlintFormat`. ktlint takes its rules from
the repository's `.editorconfig`, detekt from its own defaults plus the few
adjustments in `frontend/gradle/detekt.yml`; the version of each tool is
pinned in `frontend/gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

Every command below runs from `frontend/`:

```sh
cd frontend
./gradlew :web:wasmJsBrowserDistribution
```

The result is a directory of static files — an `index.html`, the JavaScript
loader, the WebAssembly modules and the bundled resources — in
`frontend/web/build/dist/wasmJs/productionExecutable/`. Every URL in it is
relative, so the same output can be served from the root of a site and from
a path below it without being rebuilt. Serving it needs nothing but a static
file server that returns `.wasm` as `application/wasm`.

[`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile) is that server: an nginx image that
copies a distribution built beforehand, published on every `v*` tag as
`ghcr.io/mcu-home/ui-homeassistant-app` and run as the Home Assistant App.
Because the back end does not exist yet, what it serves is the front end on
its mock data.

Gradle and the Kotlin/WebAssembly compiler together want a few gigabytes of
memory. `frontend/gradle.properties` caps both daemons and limits Gradle to
two worker processes; on a machine with more memory to spare those limits
can be raised. Do not run two builds at the same time.
